# Make-initrd arguments

There is a number of specific goals which are very useful in the generation of
the image.

- **guess-config** - This goal prints the intended configuration on stdout.
  It is compiled based on your current configuration and the feature list from
  `AUTODETECT` variable.
- **guess-modules** - This goal prints list of module needed to mount specified
  mountpoint or block device.
- **bug-report** - This goal collects system configuration data and puts those
  into an archive. If you have any problems with mkinitrd this goal will help
  to gather the information necessary for developers to diagnose and fix bugs.
